# Git

## Overview
Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development.

## Key Features
- **Branching and Merging**: Create and merge branches for parallel development.
- **Staging Area**: Selectively stage changes before committing.
- **Distributed**: Every developer has a full copy of the repository.

## Common Commands
- `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository.
- `git clone`: Clone a remote repository.
- `git add`: Stage changes for commit.
- `git commit`: Commit staged changes.
- `git push`: Push changes to a remote repository.
- `git pull`: Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository.
