# Snyk Example

## Introduction
Snyk is a security tool that helps developers find and fix vulnerabilities in their dependencies, container images, Kubernetes applications, and infrastructure as code.

## Setting up Snyk
1. **Install Snyk CLI**:
   ```sh
   npm install -g snyk
   ```

2. **Authenticate with Snyk**:
   ```sh
   snyk auth
   ```

## Scanning a Project
1. **Navigate to your project directory**:
   ```sh
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```

2. **Run a security test**:
   ```sh
   snyk test
   ```

3. **Monitor your project for vulnerabilities**:
   ```sh
   snyk monitor
   ```

## Example Configuration
Create a `snyk.config.json` file in the root of your project with the following content:

```json
{
  "org": "your-org-name",
  "token": "your-snyk-token",
  "projectName": "your-project-name",
  "files": {
    "package.json": {
      "devDependencies": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Interpreting Results
- **Vulnerabilities**: Snyk will output a list of vulnerabilities found in your project.
- **Severity Levels**: Each vulnerability will be categorized by its severity (low, medium, high, critical).
- **Fix Suggestions**: Snyk will provide suggestions on how to fix each vulnerability.

## Automating with CI/CD
Integrate Snyk into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan your projects for vulnerabilities.

### Example GitHub Actions Workflow
Create a `.github/workflows/snyk.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
name: Snyk Security Scan

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  snyk:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run Snyk to check for vulnerabilities
      uses: snyk/actions/setup@v1
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}

    - name: Test the project
      run: snyk test

    - name: Monitor the project
      run: snyk monitor
```

## Conclusion
By integrating Snyk into your development workflow, you can continuously monitor and fix vulnerabilities, ensuring your projects remain secure.
