# Trivy Example

## Introduction
Trivy is a simple and comprehensive vulnerability scanner for containers and other artifacts. It detects vulnerabilities in OS packages and application dependencies.

## Setting up Trivy
1. **Install Trivy**:
   ```sh
   sudo apt install trivy
   ```

2. **Verify Installation**:
   ```sh
   trivy --version
   ```

## Scanning Docker Images
1. **Pull a Docker Image**:
   ```sh
   docker pull your-docker-image
   ```

2. **Scan the Docker Image**:
   ```sh
   trivy image your-docker-image
   ```

## Example Configuration
Create a `.trivyignore` file in the root of your project to ignore specific vulnerabilities:

```
CVE-2020-15257
CVE-2019-14697
```

## Integrating with CI/CD
Integrate Trivy into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.

### Example GitHub Actions Workflow
Create a `.github/workflows/trivy.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
name: Trivy Vulnerability Scan

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  trivy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Docker
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1

    - name: Cache Docker layers
      uses: actions/cache@v2
      with:
        path: /tmp/.buildx-cache
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-buildx-${{ github.sha }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-buildx-

    - name: Scan Docker image with Trivy
      run: |
        docker pull your-docker-image
        trivy image your-docker-image

    - name: Upload Trivy report
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
      with:
        name: trivy-report
        path: trivy-report.html
```

## Conclusion
By integrating Trivy into your development workflow, you can continuously monitor and fix vulnerabilities, ensuring your Docker images remain secure.
