This section provides comprehensive guides and tutorials on Kubernetes, covering basics to advanced topics.

## Overview

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. This section covers Kubernetes installation, core concepts, basic usage, and advanced topics such as RBAC, networking, and monitoring.

## Kubernetes Basics

An introduction to Kubernetes, covering core concepts, installation, and basic usage.

### Core Concepts

- Overview of Kubernetes architecture.
- Understanding Pods, Nodes, and Clusters.

#### Example

```yaml
# Pod definition
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mycontainer
    image: myimage
```

### Installation

- Installing Kubernetes on various platforms.
- Setting up a local Kubernetes cluster with Minikube.

#### Example

```bash
# Install Minikube on Ubuntu
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube

# Start Minikube
minikube start
```

### Basic Usage

- Creating and managing Pods.
- Deployments, Services, and ConfigMaps.

#### Example Deployment

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mydeployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mycontainer
        image: myimage
```

## Kubernetes Advanced Topics

Explore advanced Kubernetes topics such as RBAC, networking, and monitoring.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Setting up RBAC in Kubernetes.
- Best practices for managing permissions.

#### Example RBAC Configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
```

### Networking

- Kubernetes networking model.
- Configuring Ingress controllers.

#### Example Ingress Configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: myingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: myapp.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: myservice
            port:
              number: 80
```

### Monitoring

- Tools for monitoring Kubernetes clusters.
- Setting up Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.

#### Example Prometheus Configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: Prometheus
metadata:
  name: myprometheus
spec:
  serviceMonitorSelector:
    matchLabels:
      team: frontend
```
