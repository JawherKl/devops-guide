## **1. Basics**

### **1.1 Simple Dockerfile**
#### `README.md`
```markdown
# Simple Dockerfile Example

This example demonstrates how to create a basic `Dockerfile` for a Python application.

## Steps to Run

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t my-python-app .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 4000:80 my-python-app
   ```

3. Access the application:
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:4000`.

## Key Concepts
- **Base Image**: Using `python:3.9-slim` as the base image.
- **Working Directory**: Setting the working directory with `WORKDIR`.
- **Copying Files**: Copying application files into the container with `COPY`.
- **Installing Dependencies**: Installing Python dependencies using `pip`.
- **Exposing Ports**: Making the application accessible on port 80.
- **Environment Variables**: Setting environment variables with `ENV`.
- **Running the Application**: Using `CMD` to specify the command to run the application.
```

### **1.2 Simple docker-compose.yml**
#### `README.md`
```markdown
# Simple docker-compose.yml Example

This example demonstrates how to use `docker-compose.yml` to define and run a single-service application.

## Steps to Run

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. Access the application:
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:4000`.

3. Stop the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

## Key Concepts
- **Service Definition**: Defining a service (`web`) in `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Port Mapping**: Mapping container port 80 to host port 4000.
- **Environment Variables**: Setting environment variables for the service.
- **Build Context**: Building the Docker image from the current directory.
```

## **2. Advanced**

### **2.1 Multi-Stage Build Dockerfile**
#### `README.md`
```markdown
# Multi-Stage Build Example

This example demonstrates how to use multi-stage builds in Docker to reduce the size of the final image.

## Steps to Run

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t my-node-app .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:80 my-node-app
   ```

3. Access the application:
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Key Concepts
- **Multi-stage builds**: Separating the build and runtime environments to reduce image size.
- **Build Stage**: Using `node:16` to build the application.
- **Runtime Stage**: Using `nginx:alpine` to serve the built application.
- **Copying Artifacts**: Copying only the necessary files from the build stage to the runtime stage.
```

### **2.2 Multi-Service App with docker-compose.yml**
#### `README.md`
```markdown
# Multi-Service App Example

This example demonstrates how to use `docker-compose.yml` to define and run a multi-service application (web app, Redis, and PostgreSQL).

## Steps to Run

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. Access the web application:
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`.

3. Stop the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

## Key Concepts
- **Service Dependencies**: Using `depends_on` to define service dependencies.
- **Port Mapping**: Mapping container ports to host ports.
- **Environment Variables**: Setting environment variables for the database.
- **Volumes**: Persisting PostgreSQL data using Docker volumes.
```

### **2.3 Custom Networks in docker-compose.yml**
#### `README.md`
```markdown
# Custom Networks Example

This example demonstrates how to use custom networks in `docker-compose.yml` for better service isolation.

## Steps to Run

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. Access the web application:
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`.

3. Stop the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

## Key Concepts
- **Custom Networks**: Creating separate networks (`frontend` and `backend`) for services.
- **Service Isolation**: Isolating services by attaching them to specific networks.
- **Network Communication**: Allowing services to communicate within the same network.
```

## **3. Real-World Examples**

### **3.1 Dockerfile for a Node.js Application**
#### `README.md`
```markdown
# Node.js Application Example

This example demonstrates how to create a `Dockerfile` for a Node.js application with environment variables and health checks.

## Steps to Run

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t my-node-app .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 my-node-app
   ```

3. Access the application:
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Key Concepts
- **Environment Variables**: Using `ENV` to set environment variables.
- **Health Checks**: Adding a health check to monitor the application.
- **Port Exposure**: Exposing the application on port 3000.
```

### **3.2 docker-compose.yml for a Microservices Architecture**
#### `README.md`
```markdown
# Microservices Architecture Example

This example demonstrates how to use `docker-compose.yml` to define and run a microservices-based application.

## Steps to Run

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. Access the services:
   - Auth Service: `http://localhost:3001`
   - User Service: `http://localhost:3002`

3. Stop the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

## Key Concepts
- **Microservices**: Running multiple services (`auth-service`, `user-service`, and `db`) in a single `docker-compose.yml` file.
- **Service Communication**: Using environment variables to configure service communication.
- **Database Persistence**: Persisting PostgreSQL data using Docker volumes.
```
