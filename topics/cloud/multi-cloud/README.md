# Multi-Cloud Strategies

## Overview
Multi-cloud refers to the use of multiple cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) to avoid vendor lock-in, improve resilience, and optimize costs.

## Key Benefits
- **Vendor Independence**: Avoid reliance on a single provider.
- **Resilience**: Distribute workloads across providers for high availability.
- **Cost Optimization**: Leverage the best pricing from different providers.

## Tools for Multi-Cloud Management
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as code across multiple clouds.
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration across clouds.
- **Cloud Management Platforms (CMPs)**: Tools like CloudHealth, RightScale.

## Getting Started
1. Choose a multi-cloud tool (e.g., Terraform).
2. Define infrastructure in code:
   ```hcl
   provider "aws" {
     region = "us-east-1"
   }

   provider "google" {
     project = "my-gcp-project"
     region  = "us-central1"
   }
3. Deploy resources across clouds.
