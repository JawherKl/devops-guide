### CircleCI CI/CD Pipeline Example

This example demonstrates a basic CircleCI pipeline for a Node.js application.

## Overview

CircleCI is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying your code. This example provides a basic configuration for setting up a CI/CD pipeline using CircleCI for a Node.js application.

### Prerequisites

- A Node.js application
- CircleCI account
- CircleCI project setup

### Configuration File: `.circleci/config.yml`

```yaml
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/node:14
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Install dependencies
          command: npm install
      - run:
          name: Run tests
          command: npm test
      - run:
          name: Deploy application
          command: npm run deploy

workflows:
  version: 2
  build_and_deploy:
    jobs:
      - build
```

### Explanation

- **version**: Specifies the CircleCI configuration version.
- **jobs**: Defines a sequence of steps to be executed. In this example, there is one job named `build`.
  - **docker**: Specifies the Docker image to use for the job. Here, it uses `circleci/node:14`.
  - **steps**: Lists the steps to be performed in the job.
    - **checkout**: Checks out the source code.
    - **run**: Executes the specified commands. The example includes installing dependencies, running tests, and deploying the application.
- **workflows**: Defines a workflow named `build_and_deploy` that runs the `build` job.

### Additional Configuration Examples

#### Example 1: Adding Environment Variables

```yaml
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/node:14
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: production
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Install dependencies
          command: npm install
      - run:
          name: Run tests
          command: npm test
      - run:
          name: Deploy application
          command: npm run deploy

workflows:
  version: 2
  build_and_deploy:
    jobs:
      - build
```

#### Example 2: Parallel Job Execution

```yaml
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/node:14
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Install dependencies
          command: npm install

  test:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/node:14
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Run tests
          command: npm test

  deploy:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/node:14
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Deploy application
          command: npm run deploy

workflows:
  version: 2
  build_test_deploy:
    jobs:
      - build
      - test
      - deploy
```

These additional examples show how to add environment variables and run jobs in parallel to optimize your CI/CD pipeline.

### Conclusion

This guide provides a basic setup for a CircleCI pipeline for a Node.js application. By customizing the `config.yml` file, you can tailor the CI/CD process to fit the specific needs of your project.
