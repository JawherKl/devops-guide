### GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline Example

This example demonstrates a basic GitHub Actions pipeline for a Node.js application.

## Overview

GitHub Actions is a powerful CI/CD platform integrated directly into GitHub. It allows you to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying your code. This example provides a basic configuration for setting up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for a Node.js application.

### Prerequisites

- A Node.js application
- GitHub repository

### Configuration File: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
```

### Explanation

- **name**: Specifies the name of the workflow.
- **on**: Defines the events that trigger the workflow. This example triggers on `push` events to the `main` branch.
- **jobs**: Contains the jobs to be executed.
  - **build**: Defines the build job.
    - **runs-on**: Specifies the type of runner to use.
    - **steps**: Lists the sequence of steps to be executed in the job.
      - **Checkout code**: Checks out the source code.
      - **Set up Node.js**: Sets up the Node.js environment.
      - **Install dependencies**: Installs project dependencies.
      - **Run tests**: Runs the project's tests.

### Additional Configuration Examples

#### Example 1: Adding Environment Variables

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'

    - name: Set environment variables
      run: |
        echo "NODE_ENV=production" >> $GITHUB_ENV

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
```

#### Example 2: Running Jobs in Parallel

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
```

These additional examples show how to add environment variables and run jobs in parallel to optimize your CI/CD pipeline.

### Conclusion

This guide provides a basic setup for a GitHub Actions pipeline for a Node.js application. By customizing the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file, you can tailor the CI/CD process to fit the specific needs of your project.
