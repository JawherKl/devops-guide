### GitLab CI/CD Pipeline Example

This example demonstrates a basic GitLab CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js application.

## Overview
GitLab CI/CD is a continuous integration and continuous delivery tool built into GitLab. It automates the process of building, testing, and deploying your code. This example provides a basic configuration for setting up a CI/CD pipeline using GitLab CI/CD for a Node.js application.

### Prerequisites
- A Node.js application
- GitLab account
- GitLab project setup

### Configuration File: `.gitlab-ci.yml`
```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - npm install

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm test

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - npm run deploy
```

### Explanation
- **stages**: Defines the stages of the pipeline.
  - **build**: The build stage where dependencies are installed.
  - **test**: The test stage where tests are run.
  - **deploy**: The deploy stage where the application is deployed.
- **build**: Defines the build job.
  - **stage**: Specifies the stage to which this job belongs.
  - **script**: The commands to be executed for this job.
- **test**: Defines the test job.
  - **stage**: Specifies the stage to which this job belongs.
  - **script**: The commands to be executed for this job.
- **deploy**: Defines the deploy job.
  - **stage**: Specifies the stage to which this job belongs.
  - **script**: The commands to be executed for this job.

### Additional Configuration Examples

#### Example 1: Adding Environment Variables

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

variables:
  NODE_ENV: production

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - npm install

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm test

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - npm run deploy
```

#### Example 2: Using Docker for Build Environment

```yaml
image: node:14

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - npm install

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm test

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - npm run deploy
```

These additional examples show how to add environment variables and use Docker as a build environment to optimize your CI/CD pipeline.

### Conclusion
This guide provides a basic setup for a GitLab CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js application. By customizing the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, you can tailor the CI/CD process to fit the specific needs of your project.
