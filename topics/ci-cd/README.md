## Introduction

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are essential practices in DevOps that enable teams to deliver code changes more frequently and reliably. This section covers the fundamental concepts of CI/CD and dives into popular tools used to automate these processes.

## Concepts

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: The practice of automatically integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository several times a day.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: The process of automatically deploying every change that passes all stages of the production pipeline to the end-users.

## Popular CI/CD Tools

### Jenkins

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that enables developers to build, test, and deploy their applications. It supports a wide range of plugins to integrate with various tools and technologies.

### GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD tool that allows you to automate your workflows directly from your GitHub repository. It provides a simple way to build, test, and deploy code using YAML configuration files.

### GitLab CI/CD

GitLab CI/CD is a built-in part of GitLab that provides powerful continuous integration and deployment capabilities. It uses a simple syntax to define CI/CD pipelines in a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

### CircleCI

CircleCI is a cloud-based CI/CD tool that automates the process of software development. It integrates seamlessly with GitHub and provides fast and reliable builds and deployments.

## Demo Pipeline Setup

This section provides a step-by-step guide to setting up a demo CI/CD pipeline for a sample application. The demo includes configuration files and scripts for the chosen CI/CD tool to demonstrate the entire process from code integration to deployment.

### Example: Setting Up a Pipeline with GitHub Actions

1. Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository.
2. Add a `ci.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
```

3. Commit and push the changes to your repository.

This simple pipeline checks out the code, sets up Node.js, installs dependencies, and runs tests on every push to the main branch.

## Conclusion

Implementing CI/CD practices can significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of your software development process. By understanding the concepts and leveraging the right tools, you can automate the integration and deployment of your code, ensuring faster delivery and higher quality.
