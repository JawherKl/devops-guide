## 🧭 About

**DevOps Guide** is a practical, community-driven repository that maps the full DevOps engineering path. Content is organized into focused topic folders — each with real configurations, working Dockerfiles, architecture diagrams, and annotated examples you can actually run.

The scope goes beyond the usual CI/CD-and-Docker tutorials: it covers Linux, networking, server management, programming languages used in DevOps, cloud providers, certification prep, and real-world case studies.

> ⚠️ **Work in progress** — the repository is actively evolving. Some topics have more depth than others. Stars, issues, and pull requests are all welcome.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 🐧 Linux
The foundation of every DevOps environment. Covers the filesystem hierarchy, process management, shell scripting, permissions, cron jobs, and system internals that every engineer should know.

### 🌐 Networking
Essential networking concepts for infrastructure work — TCP/IP, DNS resolution, HTTP/HTTPS, load balancing, reverse proxies (Nginx, HAProxy), firewalls, and VPNs.

### 🖥️ Server Management
Day-to-day server operations: SSH hardening, user and permission management, service management with `systemd`, package management, and configuration best practices.

### 🔄 CI/CD
Continuous Integration and Deployment pipelines with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and GitLab CI/CD. Includes real pipeline files targeting containerized applications, with stages for build, test, security scan, and deploy.

### 🐳 Containers
Docker from basics to advanced patterns — optimized image layering, multi-stage builds, Docker Compose for local dev and test environments, and image security best practices. The repository is 100% Dockerfile-based for fully runnable examples.

### ☸️ Orchestration
Kubernetes workloads and cluster management. Covers Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets, resource limits, health probes, RBAC, and Helm chart authoring.

### 🏗️ Infrastructure (IaC)
Reproducible, version-controlled infrastructure using Terraform, Ansible, and AWS CloudFormation. Examples focus on idempotency, state management, and real cloud targets.

### ☁️ Cloud
Provider-specific guides for **AWS**, **Azure**, and **GCP** — IAM, VPC/networking, compute, storage, managed services, and cost awareness. Covers both CLI and IaC approaches side by side.

### 📊 Monitoring
Full observability stack: Prometheus metrics collection, Grafana dashboards, Zipkin distributed tracing, and alerting rules. Includes pre-built dashboard configs and trace analysis patterns for microservices.

### 🔐 DevSecOps
Security integrated at every pipeline stage — container image scanning with **Trivy**, dependency auditing with **Snyk**, DAST with **OWASP ZAP**, and policy-as-code patterns.

### 🔒 Security
Infrastructure and application hardening — secrets management, CVE triage workflows, TLS/PKI basics, and least-privilege access patterns.

### 🛠️ Tools
The everyday DevOps toolbox: `make`, `jq`, `yq`, `curl`, `direnv`, and other utilities that make workflows faster and more reproducible.

### 💻 Language
Scripting and automation in **Python**, **Go**, **Bash** and **JavaScript** — the three most common languages in DevOps tooling and automation workflows.

### 🌿 Version Control
Git workflows (GitFlow, trunk-based development), commit conventions, branching strategies, git hooks, and pull request best practices for both infrastructure and application teams.

### 🏆 Certification
Structured study material for popular DevOps certifications: CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator), AWS DevOps Professional, Terraform Associate, and more.

### 📂 Case Studies
Real-world scenarios, architecture breakdowns, and post-mortems that illustrate how the tools and practices in this guide come together in production systems.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Docker & Docker Compose (for most hands-on examples)

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JawherKl/devops-guide.git
cd devops-guide
```

### Pick a topic and dive in

```bash
# Example: start with Linux foundations
cd topics/linux

# Example: run a container example
cd topics/containers

# Example: explore a CI/CD pipeline
cd topics/ci-cd
```

Each topic folder contains its own `README.md` with context, prerequisites, and step-by-step instructions.
